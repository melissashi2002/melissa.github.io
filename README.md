## Projects
### Exploring the Impact of LLMs/Gen AI-Driven Chatbots on Mental Health Advice
- Designed and developed a user-centric website to facilitate scenario-based interview, employing OpenAI’s API to explore the impact of AI-driven chatbots on mental health advice.
- Planning to conduct a computational analysis by collecting and analyzing chatbot conversations from 8 predefined scenarios to evaluate AI’s advisory patterns and users interaction.
- Collaborating with professors to design scenario-based interviews focused on ethical considerations, aiming to refine the chatbot for improved safety and efficacy. Future enhancements will be informed through planned field deployments and speculative design workshops.
  
### Stock Prediction Project
- Collaborated with a team to develop a full-stack web application for stock prediction, using Python and Flask for the back-end architecture.
- Led the front-end development, creating intuitive and visually appalling user interfaces with HTML and CSS, which significantly improved user engagement and accessibility.
- Developed and integrated sophisticated machine learning models using scikit-learn and PyTorch, leveraging PyTrend and YFinance data within SQL databases to enable real-time updates and personalized user plans, while ensuring effective collaboration and project management to deliver a high-quality product.
  
### Postpartum Depression Data Analysis 
- Analyzed and collected 200 data sourced from the TriNetX Research Network using Python for data manipulation and analysis, identifying the relationship between other disease and postpartum depression. 
- Processed 10K electronic health records (EHR) data by Python and assess the prevalence and impact of different disease on the occurrence and severity of postpartum depression. 
- Provided research findings and conclusions about the relationship between postpartum depression and other health conditions.
